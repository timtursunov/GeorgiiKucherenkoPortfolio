				<p class='about__text'>
					I want to deliver projects aimed to bring a positive impact on our lives over gaining a profit only. For this matter, I experiment with narrative styles and commonly focus on including the entertainment elements into the projects. It ensures a greater engagement from the audience whether the goal of the projects is to educate or amuse.

				<p class='about__text'>
					In general, my goal is to transform the way people see the world through film/photography. I find it meaningful to work for a company that encourages people to do the same thing within the reach of their cellphone camera. iPhone Photography School can be a great carrier of positive changes in society.

				<p class='about__text'>
					Upon discovering the Iphone's Photography School mission, I found it worthwhile to foster my editing and narration skills in this organization. I believe that initiative to inspire people to appreciate Nature's beauty consolidates the efforts to stop climate change. It merely encourages employees to apply pragmatism and seek innovations.
